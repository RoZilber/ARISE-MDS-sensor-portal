# SEARCH FUNCTION & FILTERS IN PROJECTS
A general search function and filters are available to subset projects.
- 'Search' allows you to free text search the project. For example, you can type a key word in the project name.
- 'Deployment active now?' allows you to filter by 'True' for projects which are currently active, and 'False' for projects which are no longer active.
- 'Select job' - there are currently no job options to select at project level.
